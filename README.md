Getting & Cleaning Data - Course Project
=====================
This is repo is for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data", specifically for the course project.

###To create the final data set that the project is asking for do the following:
1. Download the data used here -> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2. Extract the files from that zip file wherever you'd like
3. Download the "run_analysis.R" script from the repo. Save it in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder from the files you just extracted.
4. Run the "run_analysis.R" script there. It will save a file called "assignment_data.txt" in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder. That file is what was asked for in part one of the course project
